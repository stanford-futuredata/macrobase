Welcome to the MacroBase documentation!

This readme will walk you through navigating and building the MacroBase documentation, which is included here with the MacroBase source code.

## Prerequisites

The Spark documentation build uses a number of tools to build HTML docs.

```sh
$ sudo pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
```

## Building

To build the docs in the `site` directory:

```sh
$ mkdocs build
```

To serve the docs on localhost:

```sh
$ mkdocs serve
```
