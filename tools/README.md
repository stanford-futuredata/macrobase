## This directory contains mostly python scripts used to analyse different behaviours of macrobase

Examples:

- ``tools/run_experiment.py`` is a way to write replicatable recipes
- ``tools/macrobase_cmd.py`` is a python wrapper that let's you start macrobase from command line using python commands
- ``tools/py_analysis/`` has a collection of different plotting tools, some of which might be a little stale
