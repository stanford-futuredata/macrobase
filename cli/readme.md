### Command Line Interface to macrobase-lib

This module supports creating standard pipelines 
which can then be called from the command line with
configuration parameters set in yaml files.

Pipelines consist of operators from macrobase-lib
hooked together with possible pre/post processing.

To run a simple pipeline with a percentile classifier
& itemset mining explanation:

`
./bin/simple.sh demo/conf.yaml
